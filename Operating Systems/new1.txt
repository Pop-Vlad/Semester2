Write a C program that creates two child processes: A and B.
Process B generates one random number N between 100 and 1000.
Process A keeps generating and sending random numbers between
50 and 1050 to B until the absolute difference between N and
a number is less than 50.
B prints the generated numbers and all the received numbers.
A sends to the parent the number of numbers generated until
the condition was met, and the parent prints it.
The processes communicate through pipes.

Example:
Process B has generated 433
B received 244; difference: 189
B received 367; difference: 66
B received 723; difference: 290
B received 465; difference: 32
Process A has generated 4 numbers
