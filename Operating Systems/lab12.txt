Create two programs A and B.
Program A receives as command line arguments
multiple file names.
For each file name, it creates a child process
that calculates the file size in bytes and sends it back to the parent.
After all the file sizes have been computed,
process A sends them via fifo one by one to process B.
Process B reads the file sizes and, after all numbers are received,
creates a thread for each one that counts the number of divisors of the
number
and writes it in a file named "divisor_count".
